# litmus-tests-riscv

This litmus-tests-riscv repository contains litmus tests for the
RISC-V concurrency architecture.

Most of the litmus tests have been automatically generated by the
"diy" test generator from the diy tool suite <http://diy.inria.fr>;
others are hand-written.  The tests are in the form used by both the
diy and rmem <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/rmem> tools, for
running tests on hardware and in axiomatic and operational models, and
for test generation.

The tests are distributed subject to the BSD 2-clause licence in
