# litmus-tests-riscv

This litmus-tests-riscv repository contains litmus tests for the
RISC-V concurrency architecture.

Most of the litmus tests have been automatically generated by the
"diy" test generator from the diy tool suite <http://diy.inria.fr>;
others are hand-written.  The tests are in the form used by both the
diy and rmem <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/rmem> tools, for
running tests on hardware and in axiomatic and operational models, and
for test generation.

The tests are distributed subject to the BSD 2-clause licence in
LICENCE.

This work has been partly supported by the REMS "Rigorous Engineering
of Mainstream Systems" EPSRC Programme Grant, EP/K008528/1, 2013-2020.

FILES
-----

* LICENCE - Licence

* Makefile - For comparing results

* README.md - This file

* model-results - Results from running the rmem and Herd models on the
tests (see Makefile).

* tests - Each test is in a separate .litmus file.  Files in sub-folders
with a build.sh script were generated by running the script.  Files in
sub-folders with an X.conf file (and no build.sh script) were
generated by running 'diy7 -conf X.conf'.
